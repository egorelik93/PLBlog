# Coroutines and Continuations

The counterpart to variant types is much more difficult to
explain, in part because their scenario is related to a
rare but very useful feature in some languages called coroutines.
Some programmers may be familiar with special cases of coroutines
such as iterator generators. A coroutine is essentially
an entirely cooperative, non-preemptive thread. Some languages implement them using a task scheduler, but others, especially for the special cases, 
compile them down to a state machine and run them
manually. Generally they
are understood as being able to yield and
resume multiple times. A highly unusual perspective is that
each possible yield returns a variant, the current state 
of the state machine. Whereas a resource of
a linear variant type represents one of multiple possibilities,
a coroutine will at different points in time take on *all* 
possibilties; the only question is which is when.
Thus, linear types describing the multiple yields of
a coroutine are actually themselves the counterpart
of variant types. Traditionally, this type construct is called *par*, which is fairly evocative of the spirit of coroutines
even though they are not true parallelism since they are
cooperative.

This is all probably quite confusing. In order to explain it more properly though, we are going to need to take a detour.

## Continuations

I will come right out and say it: it probably comes as no surprise that implementing coroutines and other thread-like concepts, and in particular yielding, involves saving the current state of the coroutine. If you have already heard of the term *continuation*, then you probably already know
that they are essentially saved states of the program
that can be resumed. If you have not heard of continuations before,
then you should be thinking of them as being safe `goto` statements, or perhaps more accurately `setjmp` and `longjmp`,
each carrying a label and the saved state that will be needed
at that label. Continuations are perhaps the single most flexible
programming language feature ever designed, but much like `goto` 
statements themselves they are perhaps *too* flexible.
The traditional continuation implemented in a few traditional
programming languages is more than just a goto statement,
because like everything else in such languages the continuation
must be copyable and disposable too! Copying continuations
turns out to be too expensive to be practical. We do not have
this requirement in a linear type system, so we are free 
to implement continuations quite cheaply!

This turns out to be very important, because continuations, or
rather their types, are actually *the* defining
characteristic of Classical Linear Logic, compared to other
linear type systems.

First, let us discuss what continuations
could look like in a Rust-like language.

Many programmers from C-syntax languages are familiar with the
`return` statement for exiting from a subroutine and providing
a result. Rust is expression-oriented, and as such the return
statement is not needed at the end of a function,
but Rust still uses it to support *early return*.
In that spirit, I propose that the `return` keyword
can be used by itself to denote a resource of type
`Return<T>`, where `T` is the return type of the function.
Resources of this type can be called as if they were a single-argument function of type `T`,
except that doing so will act as an early return.

    fn f() -> i32 {
        let k = return;
        k(10)
    }

In fact, this resource can be passed to and called
from a nested function, and it will actually act as
an early return not just from the nested function
but also the function it was created in.

    fn f() -> i32 {
        let k = return;
        let f = || k(5);
        f()
    }

This resource is an example of a continuation,
specifically representing resuming the caller of the
function it was created it.
What is happening is that a continuation
of type `Return<T>` 
stores the return information from the function it was created in,
usually the caller's return address and a pointer to the
caller's stack frame. Most function calling conventions
already place these two pieces of information onto the stack
whenever a function is called. Calling this continuation
restores this stack frame, jumps to the return address,
and provides the given value as output,
just like an ordinary `return` statement.

If you are familiar with Rust's borrowing logic, 
you might expect that this stack pointer is
borrowed by `Return<T>`. Rust currently lacks
the concept of an 'owned' reference, but that is probably
the closest comparison. Unlike Rust's 'borrowed' reference types,
one cannot just 
drop the `Return<T>` and regain access to the stack frame; 
one must resume the continuation in order to consume it,
and only inside that executing continuation is access restored.
Otherwise, the continuation cannot be disposed; it is our first example
of a type that *must* be linear and not affine.
The continuation is in that regard a bit like a closure that takes
ownership of its environment. However, when it 
comes to the role of the lifetime system in ensuring that a reference
does not outlive the location it refers to, 
it is fair to say that `Return<T>` must have a lifetime
restricted to the function it is in;
the stack frame needs to be disposed
when the calling function itself returns, and that is not
possible as long as a `Return<T>` is pointing to it.
The real Rust lifetime system might solve this with the creation of some sort of "local function" lifetime. I have a 
slightly different
solution in mind that we will return to, 
but for now, let us just say that there
is a trait marking types that can escape the function,
and `Return<T>` is *not* one of them. As a consequence, one cannot
just call another continuation while a more recent one is in scope,
as the latter will not have been consumed by the time its lifetime ends, which is illegal for
a non-affine type. In fact, that leads me to my next point.

A very important aspect of calling a continuation is that
*there will be no opportunity for resources to be disposed
afterwards*. Actually, this is an issue even when just using early return; it is just invisible in an affine type system
because everything will automatically get cleaned up
when it needs to be. A proper linear type checker
would need to enforce that all resources in the current
context are either explicitly or implicitly disposed
before the continuation gets called. Unlike in some languages,
writing code after the continuation call will be forbidden.

To elaborate on the last point a bit, many languages, Rust included, treat unreachable code as being safe. Rust
actually has a type, written `!` and named "never", used to
represent the return type of functions that never return, but
many other languages are still able to reason about local
unreachable code within a given function. The assumption
is that because the code will never run, it can pretend to
do whatever it wants; Rust assumes that `!` can be turned into
any type. That is only possible because these
languages are at least affine. The danger in a linearly typed
language is that unreachable code "tricks" the compiler
into thinking that a resource is disposed, 
even though the destructor will never actually be called.
If a function never returns because it jumped to some continuation,
then such resources have been leaked.
An affine language can make sure that everything will be disposed
before that point regardless.

There actually are cases where unreachable code can be safe,
for example if we wish to indicate that a function always throws an error or if it runs
in an infinite loop. We can continue to use `!` to represent
such cases, where it has the same meaning as the *empty enum*. To contrast with such cases, we will denote the return type
of a continuation as `noreturn`. In fact, a broader view of continuations is that they are *precisely* those functions of
the special return type `noreturn`, with `Return<T>` being a particular implementation of the trait `FnOnce(T) -> noreturn`
with a particular lifetime.
Using other impementations of this trait is also an alternative to trying to return a `Return<T>` from a function.
In traditional formulations, `!` is sometimes called the *Zero* type,
because there are no expressions of this type, and `noreturn` the *Bottom* type, for reasons that I will not get into.

There are some caveats to discuss when capturing the current continuation of a function. First, once you have chosen
to use `return` in this way, you are obligating yourself to 
use continuations to return from the function. The function block will
expect that the last expression is of type `noreturn`,
and you will not be able to provide an expression of any other
type to implicitly return. Second, the `return` continuation is still a resource; once you have captured it, you will not be able to capture it again, except as where choice is involved.

Finally, I need to remark a bit on the special nature of `noreturn`. In the actual Rust language, and up until now in this
document, all function return types have been of resources 
that can actually be written onto the stack as the
output of a function. All such types are forced to be Sized,
even `!` technically.
Though, there are capabilities like `alloca` in the low-level
intermediate languages that allow for dynamic memory allocation
on the stack. Whether that could one day allow for other possibilities remains to be seen. The point though is that,
at bare minimum, `noreturn` cannot possibly be a type
that allows resources to be written onto the stack,
because morally expressions of this type cannot do anything
except propagate the `noreturn` higher up. In that regard,
it needs to be understood that there are many places where any type normally would be allowed but `noreturn` is not,
for example as the type of a function argument. In some
ways it is similar to unsized types like `[T]`, the
dereferenced array slice of type `T` and unknown length. As we mentioned with calling a `Return<T>`,
all other resources must have been disposed before you can start 'returning' a `noreturn`.
We will have to get into the exact nature of `noreturn` later.

There is one rather fundamental function that continuations support called `call_with_current_continuation`. With the above design, it is rather easy to implement.

    fn call_with_current_continuation<F, T>(k : F) -> T 
      where F : FnOnce(Return<T>) -> noreturn
    {
        k(return)
    }

Such a function is possible in ordinary code only because `Return<T>` *must* be the continuation
called at the end of `k`, by virtue of being unable to escape or be consumed any other way.
Had we not had such a restriction, it would be possible to store this continuation somewhere else and run some other
continuation instead. This would wreak havoc on the stack under ordinary calling conventions, 
as the continuation will have resumed further down than it started.
The only ways to support such a thing would be either an alternate calling convention that allows functions
return lower on the stack than they were called, or a continuation passing transform (and in practice these seem to be the same).

## Coroutines

Now, I did mention that continuations are fundamental
to Classical Linear Logic. The reason is that they
relate each type operators to its "opposite"
in a sense.
In fact, they allow us to *derive* the second half of the type operators
from the first half. It turns out that the continuation of a variant is *exactly* a choice, and vice-versa:

    trait MyChoice {
        fn choice1(self) -> i32;
        fn choice2(self) -> i64;
    }

    enum MyEnum {
        Choice1(Return<i32>),
        Choice2(Return<i64>)
    }

    fn choiceToCont<C : MyChoice>(c : C) -> 
        impl FnOnce(MyEnum) -> noreturn
    {
        |e| match e {
            Choice1(ki32) -> ki32(c.choice1()),
            Choice2(ki64) -> ki64(c.choice2())
        }
    }

    fn contToChoice<K : FnOnce(MyEnum) -> noreturn>(k : K) ->
        impl MyChoice
    {
        choice MyChoice {
            choice1: || {
                k(MyEnum::Choice1(return))
            },
            choice2: || {
                k(MyEnum::Choice2(return))
            }
        }
    }

If you noticed where I've been heading, then you might have guessed by now that multi-yield coroutine types
are actually the continuation of structs. You would be correct.
This is the only definition of linear coroutines
that I have come across.

    trait Par<A, B> {
        fn execute_par<K1, K2>(self, k1 : K1, k2 : K2) -> noreturn
            where K1 : FnOnce(A) -> noreturn, 
                  K2 : FnOnce(B) -> noreturn;
    }

A simple syntax for building this sort of construct is much less
obvious than for choice, but I will give it my best shot.
Inspired by languages with syntax for iterator generator functions, let's suppose that in place of the return type
of an ordinary function, we can write:

    coroutine(value1 : i32, value2 : i64)

Each of the "variable names" of this spec refers
to one of the yields of the coroutine body,
which is done with a new syntax `yield <name>`.
As with `return`, this can either be used to immediately
yield a given value of the specified type,
or it can be used by itself as a continuation resource
of type `Return<T>`.
The body must eventually use all of these yields.
These replace the `return` keyword, which will not be available for use, nor will implicit return be allowed
as the function body expects to end in noreturn.

    fn fork<T>() -> coroutine(send : Return<T>, receive : T) 
    {
        yield receive call_with_current_continuation(yield send)
    }

Obviously, this cannot be called like an ordinary function,
or `Return<T>` wouldn't be allowed as one of the yield types.
Every call to a coroutine must be destructured by a new
syntax of the existing keyword `continue`:

    fn id(t : T) -> T 
    {
        continue fork()
        {
            send => send(t),
            received => return received
        }
    }

    fn spawn<F : FnOnce(B) -> C>(f : F) -> 
        coroutine(send : Return<B>, receive : C)
    {
        continue fork()
        {
            sendB => yield send sendB,
            receiveB => yield receive f(receiveB)
        }
    }

Each branch of this syntax refers to one of the yields of
the coroutine, captures the output of each yield
into the given variable name,
in the order specified by the coroutine spec &mdash; 
the names used
in the coroutine body are not significant, only their order.
Each branch must end with a `noreturn`.
Unlike with `match`, all branches will eventually get
run, so linear resources can only be used by one branch.

There is one circumstance where you do not need this
`continue` syntax, and that is when you directly want to
implement one coroutine with another.

    fn myFork() -> coroutine(_ : Return<T>, _ : T)
    {
        let idFn = |x| x;
        spawn(idFn)
    }

As with `continue` syntax, the yields will be associated with each other by
order in the coroutine spec, so they do not need to be named
here.

Keep in mind that unlike ordinary functions, coroutines
do not clean up their stack frame. Such stack frames
will continue to build up until an ordinary calling
function returns, so do be careful about overusing them.
This, however, is why they can return `Return<T>`.

Let us now demonstrate the connection between coroutines
and structs:

    trait MyChoice {
        fn choice1(self) -> i32;
        fn choice2(self) -> i64;
    }

    struct MyStruct {
        field1 : Return<i32>,
        field2 : Return<i64>
    }

    fn contToCoroutine(k : Return<MyStruct>) -> 
        coroutine(yield1 : i32, yield2 : i64)
    {
        k(MyStruct {
            field1 : yield yield1,
            field2 : yield yield2
        })
    }

    fn coroutineToCont<F>(f : F) 
        -> impl FnOnce(MyStruct) -> noreturn
        where F : FnOnce() -> coroutine(i32, i64)
    {
        |s| {
            continue f()
            {
                yield1Value => s.field1(yield1Value),
                yield2Value => s.field2(yield2Value)
            }
        }
    }

We can also apply this to show that `noreturn`
is exactly the continuation of the empty struct.
For that reason, we define that `noreturn`
is actually just a synonym for `coroutine()`,
and in fact is treated as a coroutine type for syntax
purposes.
Similarly, we can show that `coroutine(return : T)` can
be converted to and from an actual return type `T`, assuming `T`
is valid as such. The former is still considered a coroutine
in both runtime characteristics and required calling syntax.

    fn valueToCoroutine(i : i32) -> 
        coroutine(yield1 : i32)
    {
        yield yield1 i
    }

    fn coroutineToValue<F>(f : F) -> i32
        where F : FnOnce() -> coroutine(i32)
    {
        continue f()
        {
            yield1Value => return yield1Value
        }
    }


In general though, these
`coroutine` specs are not themselves types, but are part
of a generalized function type.
If you want to use these as a type, the closest
is what we did above with the trait 

    FnOnce() -> coroutine(T1, T2, T3,...)

There is one seeming exception to this; a coroutine "type" spec,
like what you see above in the trait, can also be part of a choice. Of course, that is because the types in a choice
are themselves really the return types of a function.
As with implementing one coroutine on top of another,
you can pass in a coroutine to a choice by calling it
without `continue` syntax.

    fn myCoroutine() -> coroutine(_ : Return<T>, _ : T)
    {
        fork()
    }

    choice{
        choice1 : 5,
        choice2 : myCoroutine()
    }

It may not seem like it, but this foundation is enough to do some
interesting stuff! Such as this type:

    trait ListBuilderInterface<T>
    {
        fn break(self) -> noreturn;
        fn next(self) -> coroutine(Return<T>, ListBuilder<T>)
    }

    struct ListBuilder<T>{
        item: Box<dyn ListBuilderInterface<T>>
    };

This type,
which is a formulation of the continuation of a linked list,
actually allows us to construct a linked list
using generator-like syntax:

    fn generate<T, F>(generator : F) -> LinkedList<T>
        where F : FnOnce(ListBuilder<T>) -> noreturn
    {
        fn break(returnResult : Return<LinkedList<T>>) -> noreturn
        {
            returnResult(LinkedList::Empty)
        }

        fn next(returnResult : Return<LinkedList<T>>) -> coroutine(
            returnNext : Return<T>,
            builder : ListBuilder<T>)
        {
            returnResult(
                LinkedList::Cons(
                    call_with_current_continuation(yield returnNext),
                    generate(yield builder))
            )
        }

        generator(ListBuilder { 
            item: box choice ListBuilderChoice<T> {
                break : break(return),
                next : next(return)
            }
        })
    }

    let myList = generate(|b| {
        let b = (|| continue b.item.next()
        {
            returnItem => returnItem(1),
            b => return b
        })();

        let b = (|| continue b.item.next()
        {
            returnItem => returnItem(2),
            b => return b
        })();

        let b = (|| continue b.item.next()
        {
            returnItem => returnItem(3),
            b => return b
        })();

        b.item.break()
    })

If this seems clunky, that's probably
because b.item.next() is returning a coroutine.
But, consider what this coroutine does:
on one branch, we input an item into `Return<i32>`,
which adds it to the list.
On the other branch, we are just returning a new builder back to the
outside. 
Since we are basically inputting an `i32` and outputting
a `ListBuilder<i32>`, couldn't we instead
replace this with a function `FnOnce(i32) -> ListBuilder<i32>`.
The answer is yes! In fact, it is *always* true
that `coroutine(Return<A>, B)` can be replaced with
`FnOnce(A) -> B`; they are equivalent types.

    fn fnToCoroutine<A, B, F : FnOnce(A) -> B>(f : F) -> 
        coroutine(input : Return<A>, output : B)
    {
        let a = call_with_current_continuation(yield input);
        yield output f(a)
    }

    fn coroutineToFn<A, B, F>(f : F) 
        -> impl FnOnce(A) -> B
        where F : FnOnce() -> coroutine(Return<A>, B)
    {
        |a| {
            continue f()
            {
                send => send(a),
                received => return f(received)
            }
        }
    }

With some refactoring, now we could write:

    let myList = generate(|b| {
        let b = b.item.next(1);
        let b = b.item.next(2);
        let b = b.item.next(3);
        b.item.break()
    })

In general, it seems that you can create a similar
generator for any type `T` by identifing a convenient `Builder`
type equivalent to a continuation of `T`, and then having users
write functions `FnOnce(Builder) -> noreturn`.

Let me try to write up the more
traditional rules for coroutines and continuations.
These will look strange compared to the earlier rules,
because coroutines require some special machinery in the rules,
and I am taking some shortcuts to get the idea across.
