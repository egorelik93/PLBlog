# Generalized Return Types, or Codata

Throughout the last section, we had to reiterate that
coroutine specs were not themselves types, but a generalization
of the usual function type. That was only partly true,
a simplification we made to introduce the concept.
Coroutine specs can be considered as types,
but they are very different from ordinary types
in a language like Rust. We did leave one hint though;
we first gave a definition for a coroutine interface as a *trait*,
an interface that various types can be declared to implement. In fact, we did the same when we defined *Choice*.
As experienced Rust developers will know, and has been assumed
throughout this document, this is exactly how Rust handles function "types" already, and they are fundamentally of the
same nature as coroutines and choice in this respect.
All of these can be treated as "types" in the same way.

The treatment presented here is directly based on the concept of 
type *polarity*, as well as Paul-Blain Levy's related *Call-By-Push-Value*. The fundamental characteristic of these
systems is the division of types into the familiar *data* types,
also called *value* types or *positive* types, and the less well-known *computational* types, also called
*codata* types or *negative* types. Simply put, data types
describe the *parameter types* of a function, and computational types
describe the *return type* of a function (or perhaps more accurately, the *computation* that the function
is doing).

The vast majority of types in Rust, in particular those that are `Sized` and `Unpin` (moveable),
are constructing by moving or writing data into a target location, whereas they can be eliminated in place
by reading this data. From a theoretical perspective, the relative order of these read operations cannot change the computation,
and thus the treatment I learned in [school](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f18/lectures/19-focusing.pdf) referred to these elimination operations as *asynchronous*. In contrast,
because data can no longer be read once it has been moved somewhere else, the order of write operations
relative to anything else is relevant. Such construction operations are correspondingly called *synchronous*.
A *positive* type is one whose construction is synchronous but whose elimination is asynchronous. 
Expressions of such types are *eagerly evaluated*. 
Such types tend to be *inductively defined* by their constructors, or what functional programmers
call *data types*.

In contrast, functions are something constructed entirely at compile-time;
by themselves no data is moved around at runtime except for a function pointer being copied.
This construction operation is asynchronous. When we do need to move around data is when 
we pass an argument to the function in order to eliminate the latter; this is when the real
computation actually happens. The elimination of a function is thus synchronous.
A type with asynchronous construction and synchronous elimination is a called a *negative* type.
Expressions of such types are essentially *lazily evaluated*.
Such types tend to be *coinductively defined* by their elimination operators (which I may at times refer to as *destructors*),
and thus are sometimes called *codata* types. Functions, too, are technically defined by their elimination: the function body specifies
what will happen at elimination time.

As I mentioned, most traditional data types are positive, including structs and enums.
Functions types are the prime example of a negative type, except that there
is no such type in Rust, only traits. 
Choice and coroutines also have negative "types", since they are constructed by defining the computations that will run at elimination time. As with functions, Rust can only express such "types" as traits.
However, a Rust-like language could understand these as types by accepting that negative types
lack some of the capabilities of positive types. This is possible if we restrict function types to having positive *parameter* types and a negative
*return* type &mdash; thus why I used those terms at the start of this page.
Positive type operators must be used with positive types, and negative type operators with negative types.
We also need to restrict *variables* of negative types, which for now means disallowing them entirely.

We can then write "curried" function types like `Fn(A) -> Fn(B) -> C`.

Of course, normal functions return data types all the time, and functional programmers
are used to being able to pass around functions as values. The way that polarized presentations
understand this is that we have types that convert between positive and negative types.
The negative to positive conversion, for a negative type `T`, can be understood as a generalized *closure* type:
a type that stores an 'environment' of some type `G` and is associated with a function `Fn(G) -> T`.
This should be very familiar to Rust and functional programmers.
In keeping with Rust syntax, let us say that `impl T` can be used where appropriate to 
refer to any closure type of `T` known at compile time and `dyn T` to the general
type of all trait objects with a closure type of `T` and a pointer to the corresponding function.
Let us say that the syntax for creating a closure from an expression of negative type is to just
write the expression wherever the closure type is expected, such as a function argument or
a variable definition, and it will automatically be converted into a closure. Of course,
the type itself needs to be the closure type and not the negative type.

    fn invoke(f : impl Fn(A) -> B) -> Fn(A) -> B
    {
        ...
    }

    doSomething(invoke(myFun))

We actually already have a candidate from the last page for the positive to negative direction:

    Fn(Return<T>) -> noreturn

In general, we can understand the conversions from positive to negative types
as creating different *calling conventions*.
For consistency with existing syntax though, let us say that a positive type
that appears in a return type position is automatically converted to a negative type according
to the "ordinary" calling convention for the language, whatever that may be.

The use of `Return<T>` above probably raised the question "what about continuations?" Are they positive
or negative? Well, that gets a little complicated. You might expect that since we described
continuations being like functions, they would be negative. You might also recall
that I said that choices are the continuations of enums and coroutines are the continuations of structs,
which would seem to support that. I also said that this works in the opposite direction, which would seem to require that
continuations are positive.

Well, the truth is that we really need `Return<T>` specifically to be a function argument above, so it has to be positive.
It may be more fair to say that `Return<T>` is a specific closure type of continuation. We also said that
`Return<T>` cannot itself be returned. For the general concept of a continuation, though,
theory suggests that it should reverse the polarity of what it is given, and that `(dyn Fn(T) -> noreturn) -> noreturn` should
be equivalent to `T`. That is for a pure lambda calculus however. While it is certainly true that
we can extract a value of type `T` from this "double continuation," when it comes to actual computation with effects, 
the pure theory doesn't quite hold as the double continuation is closer to a computation `Fn() -> T`, which I suppose without effects
would be equivalent to `T` but here isn't. For our purposes, continuation functions `Fn(T) -> noreturn`
are thus negative, but it is still interesting to consider that for every type there is another type of the opposite
polarity acting as its abstract "continuation."

Without that caveat, our type operators would be split evenly between positive and negative types.
Even with the caveat, though, all of our negative type operators can be expressed as the continuation of one of the positive type operators.
It is my suspicion that negative types in general arise as the continuations of positive types.
