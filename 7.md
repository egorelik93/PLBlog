# Order of Consumption

Let us now return to the *exchange* rule. Remember from [before](2.md) that this rule
says that order of variables is irrelevant.

$$
\begin{matrix}
G_1, y : T_2, x : T_1 \vdash e : T_3 \\
\hline
G_1, x : T_1, y : T_2 \vdash e : T_3
\end{matrix}
$$

Much as Rust allows full control of the *contraction* rule with the `Copy` and `Clone` traits
and partial control of the *weakening* rule with the `Drop` trait, I am interested in what would
happen if we allowed control of the exchange rule.

First, we need to understand what it means to *not* have the exchange rule.
I said before before that it literally means that we must use variables in the order they are given.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves and take this too literally, however, 
because in the usual presentation of substructural rules,
*usage* comes entirely from *consumption*; all resources are understood as being *owned*.
Rust, however, extends our ability to use a resource with *non-consuming* uses called *borrowing*.
If we forbade *all* uses of variables out of order, like in the stack data structure,
then we would be losing the ability of machines to *random-access* out of order locations in memory.
This does not seem very useful for writing programs (though it may be useful
for something like files on disk, where random-access is expensive).
In my opinion, the most useful interpretation of non-exchangable variables is, like Rust's lifetime system,
to model the *call stack discipline* of most programs &mdash; variables can be referenced in any order
but must be disposed or otherwise consumed in the given order.
We can always create individual types where borrowing provides no useful operations and all uses must be from these ordered consumptions. We already mentioned one candidate user of this, `Return<T>`.

The next question, then, is how do we selectively add back exchange? If we try to use the same approach as the other substructural rules and directly come up with a trait for exchangable types, we run into the issue that there are now *two* types involved in the exchange, and there is no obvious way to orient the trait around a single type. Besides, most order requirements on the
call stack seem to involve individual variables depending on a relative order rather than their types. I started from considering
that every set of variables would be (implicitly) equipped with a *linear* ordering &mdash; what the lack of exchange normally implies
where there is a single ordered sequence the variables can be listed in.
Exchange would be modeled as having a choice between multiple orders.
However, I was very tempted by how Rust's lifetime system specifies relative order as a *directed acyclic graph* of in-type dependencies;
each participating variable's type contains the lifetimes of the variables that it must be consumed before.
This system create a *partial* order - some variables are *independent* of each other and have no particular relative
order. What ultimately convinced me is that it turns out there is a theorem that the set of all possible
topological sortings of a directing acyclic graph is unique. Thus, in theory the orders specified by directed acyclic graphs
should be representable as some choice of linear orders. These choices can be extremely complex, however,
so specifying order as a sort of lifetime system should be much more easily usable.

Here is what this might look like as a new lifetime system in Rust-like syntax. For every variable `x` that is in
scope, `'x` denotes the *lifetime* of `x`. As in Rust, we can also introduce new lifetimes as type-level parameters;
we however need to be careful that these do not conflict with the names of any variables that will be introduced.
The syntax `'x * 'y` is used to indicate the lifetime that is the intersection of `'x` and `'y`.

Unlike in Rust, passing a lifetime as a type-level parameter does *not* specify the relative order of the resulting type.
To specify a value of a type is order-restricted, we instead introduce the syntax `'l ! T`, where `'l` is a lifetime, including interesections of lifetimes. A variable `x : 'l ! T` is just like a variable of type `T` except that it must be consumed
before any of the variables `'l` comes from are consumed. *Consuming* in our case means
