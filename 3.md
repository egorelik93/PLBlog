# Before we go on: Some Conventions

Up to this point, I have attempted to give an overview of what
substructural type systems are, in order to help establish a 
baseline understanding that I do not need to explain further. From 
here on out, I will attempt to explain my own vision for a 
programming language building upon this baseline. 

Instead of trying to define my own syntax right now, which is 
incomplete anyway, I will instead begin by trying to explain the 
important *concepts* using Rust syntax. Rust has become relatively 
mainstream, and furthermore has C-style syntax, so I am hoping that 
this will
help get to the essence of what I am trying to explain without 
needing to involve other complications. However, it is necessary to 
explain where I will be diverging from what is already in Rust:

- Unlike Rust, my language is not affine but supports true linear
  types. Rust defines custom destructor code using the `Drop` 
  trait, but this cannot replace the default destruction of
  the structure of all types, nor can the latter be suppressed,
  except for means that risk the resource being leaked.
  My language would have one trait that defines whether
  or not a linear type has a destructor that can be implicitly
  called (which would make it affine). Types that do not
  have such a destructor must be used explicitly.
  To get around the exception unwinding problem, we will also 
  need some sort of `Unwind` trait implemented by all types, which 
  would define a destructor-like
  subroutine but only in the context of exception unwinding.
  Unlike with real destructors, an unwind implementation
  can abort the entire program if there is no safe way to
  clean up or leak the resource - which is more palatable 
  given my separate opinion that exceptions should be reserved
  for extreme situations.
- I will not be making use of Rust's form of the lifetime system.
  There is a great deal of work going into formalizing Rust's
  lifetime system, with initiatives such as [RustBelt](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/); I am simply choosing to go in a different
  direction with a lifetime system. We will get to that later. That being said, Rust is, as far as I am aware, the origin of lifetime
  systems as a solution to borrowing, so the influence of Rust
  on any future such systems, including the direction I am going in,
  cannot be overstated.
- In Rust, all types are moveable, but some characteristics
  of immoveable types can be recovered via the `Unpin` marker trait
  and the `Pin` type. In my language, not all types are moveable.
  In an actual Rust-like setting, this could work similarly to
  `?Sized`, where the `Sized` trait is always referenced by default
  and `?Sized` is used to mark situations where we want to go beyond
  that.
- I treat closures as moving their environment by default.
